Automatic Video Chapter Creator with BERT NextSentencePrediction and KeySentenceGenerator

## 1.1 Introduction
Introducing **V**ideo **C**hapter creato**R**

Video Chapter creatoR(abbreviated **VCR**) is a technology that automatically creates chapters of videos. Videos, especially in the field of education, typically are long and tend to be one-shot-made. These videos are convenient to make in the aspect of video creator, however, not very efficient in the aspect of learner. 

There can be various purposes for learners to watch certain education video. For example, one might want to know every single details of the video. He or she can just watch the whole video and will be satisfied. 

*However*, other learners might not be sure whether he/she should watch this video or not, or might just want to skim through the video to search for few topics. For learners explained above, one-shot-made video, without any timeline that explains when this film deals with which topic, is inefficient. VCR is created, in order to solve this inefficiency.
